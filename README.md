# A Little Demo

A Little Demo is a game I made in Fall 2024 for my 2D Asset Foundations class using assets I designed in the class.

# About

This whole game is built around this little fox. Their name is Strudel. As part of my 2D Asset Foundations class, I was tasked with drawing by hand a character to then turn into a pixel art character, and Strudel was the result of that. I was so happy with their design that they ended up being the character I built my entire final project around. This project mostly serves to show off my art skills with the animations for Strudel, the tilesets, and the backgrounds, but I am pleased with the final result.

# How to Play

In order to play the game, you must have Godot 4.4 installed. Import the repository when you turn on Godot, open the project, then hit the triangular play button in the top right corner of the editor.

Arrow keys to move, Shift to run, Spacebar or up arrow to jump.
